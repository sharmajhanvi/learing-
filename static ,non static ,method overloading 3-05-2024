Static 
=========
static decleared by using static keyword,
Static variable and method both are save  in class area.
Static occopy less memory becacuse static method or variable exist per one copy.
static is associated with a class.

Non Static 
============
non sataic decleared by using without static
non static method or variable both are present in heap area
non static occopy more memory because non static method or variable present in every object 
non static is associated with the class o of object.

Method Overloading
====================
Defining multiple method with same name but different parameter
eg.  public class Abc{
       void xy(int n,int n2){    //if here i am using static means it has only one copy,satic nhi use  kiey hai matlab ye sare object mai present hoga 
       System.out.println(n1+n2);
      }
       void xy(int n,int n2,int n3){
       System.out.println(n1+n2+n3);
      }
       void xy(int n,double n2){
       System.out.println(n1+n2);
      }
public static void main(String [] args){
Abc x=new Abc(3,5);
Abc x=new Abc();
Abc x=new Abc();
x.xy;
